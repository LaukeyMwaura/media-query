            <p>Mangoes are one of the world's favourite foods. But I must explain 
                to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
                 praising pain was born and I will give you a complete 
            account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great 
            explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
             rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
              but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
               encounter consequences that are extremely painful.</p>
